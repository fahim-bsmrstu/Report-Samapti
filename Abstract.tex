Bengali is one of the ten most spoken languages in the world, with almost 200 million speakers. Growing online resources reveal a clear need for Bengali language applications and retrieval systems. The development of the internet, there are huge number of Bangla news articles are published every day on the web from different sources and this amount is growing rapidly day by day. Therefore, people have not enough time to read each document with a specified time limit. Bangla document ranking handles this difficulty with an efficient manner. Although, there are more works have been done in English and other European languages, but there is no contribution are present in bangla language to rank a document.  In our thesis, we rank bangla document using term frequency and cosine similarity. We take document as vector and query as vector. We measure term frequency each word in each document. Then finding out score using cosine similarity. Then sorted the scores and ranked the documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for bangla document ranking.
