\section{Organization of the Thesis}
%
The dissertation is organized as follows: 

\begin{itemize}

\item {•} \textbf{Chapter 1 Introduction.} In this chapter an introduction to the periodic patterns mining researches is presented. The definition, importance and existing approaches are clearly introduced. After that, the dissertation focuses the contribution. 

\item {•} \textbf{Chapter 2 Related Work.} This chapter first shows the state of the art methods of the periodic patterns mining research. Then describe two existing periodic pattern mining works $PSEMiner$ and $ListMiner$ in dynamic networks. The limitations of these methods are clearly addressed, as these are the focuses of this dissertation. 

\item {•} \textbf{Chapter 3 SPBMiner.} We present our proposed technique for mining periodic behaviors in dynamic networks.  

\item {•} \textbf{Chapter 4 Experiments Analysis.} In this chapter, it has been shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.

\item {•} \textbf{Chapter 5 Conclusion and Future Work.} Finally, this chapter concludes the dissertation indicating the limitations and future works.
